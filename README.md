# Preparatory Workshop to CLTK Workshop with Intro to NLP and Programming for Classicists (partly EN, partly DE)

This is a repository which hosts the cheatsheet (and its LaTeX code) from an introductory workshop 
to Natural Language Processing. The audience were classicists without previous knowledge of programming or NLP basics. 
The workshop was only 2-3h, so I tried to put lots of information on this cheatsheet which can be printed out 
for later reference. 

There are also slides to go with this. 

The sections on Python contain mostly content copied from other freely available sources 
(such as the NLTK ebook or the CLTK docs). 

The goal is for a Classicist to have enough of an idea of all of this and 
an introduction to programming concepts so that they're hopefully able to use CLTK ;)


Sadly, this is partly in German and partly in English only, so it's mostly fit for German native speakers.

Parts of this (intro to programming) were published in a [blog post](https://latex-ninja.com/2019/10/30/a-short-intro-to-the-key-concepts-of-computer-programming/).

## The original workshop
The original workshop was called 'Digitale Sprachverarbeitung für historische Disziplinen' and was held at Karl-Franzens-Universität Graz in November 2019.
